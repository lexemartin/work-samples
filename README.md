#Work Samples

1. [Maine Yarn Cruise](https://www.maineyarncruise.com/) - [Page One Web Solutions](https://www.pageonewebsolutions.com/) (P1WS) - Wordpress site with mapping functionality for tours and back end membership capabilities for prizes. Most of the heavy lift of this site is on the back end, but essentially it allows the Maine Yarn Cruise manager to generate new codes for check-ins and manage prizes as time passes.
2. [Sterling Controls](thttps://sterlingcontrols.com/) - P1WS - WP project. Rebuild. Basic functionality, but the client was very impressed with this and it was done in less than the allotted time which is always nice when things are under scope.
3. [Alert Reels](https://alertreels.com/) - P1WS - WP project. This has a lot of customized ecommerce development. Woocommerce. Includes complex filtering for product listings, and inventory update script.
4. [Manufacturers Association of Maine](https://mainemfg.com/) - Recent work with Page One Web Solutions. This WordPress site exceeds the functionality typically included in a Page One project. It includes a paid membership area, calendar, and job board, all created through plugins that needed to be tied together with custom code.
5. [Garmey Law](https://garmeylaw.com/) - A more standard WordPress build for a Page One client.
6. [Windjammer Angelique](https://www.sailangelique.com/) - The Windjammer Angelique website is another WordPress build that I did for Owlsheal Solutions. It was an interesting small business build.
